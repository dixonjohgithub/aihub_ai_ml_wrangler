## Implementation Summary

### Frontend Components Created:
1. **FileDropzone** - Drag-and-drop upload interface with visual feedback
2. **ProgressTracker** - Real-time upload progress with cancellation
3. **ImportSummary** - File preview and management interface
4. **App** - Main demo application showcasing all features

### Backend Services Created:
1. **FileStorageService** - Secure file handling and validation
2. **VirusScanService** - Security scanning with ClamAV integration
3. **Upload API** - FastAPI endpoints for file operations

### Key Features Implemented:
- âœ… Drag-and-drop file upload
- âœ… File type validation (CSV, JSON only)
- âœ… File size limits (100MB max)
- âœ… Real-time progress tracking
- âœ… File preview generation
- âœ… Error handling and retry mechanisms
- âœ… Virus scanning integration
- âœ… Secure file storage
- âœ… Data Wrangler file pattern recognition

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, react-dropzone
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.10+, Pandas, ClamAV
- **Security**: File validation, MIME type checking, virus scanning

## Testing Strategy

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and validation:

1. **Client-side validation**: File type, size, and format checks
2. **Server-side validation**: MIME type verification, security scanning
3. **Progress tracking**: Real-time upload status with cancellation
4. **Error recovery**: Retry mechanisms for failed uploads
5. **Security**: Virus scanning and file quarantine capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies and test the implementation
2. Create sample Data Wrangler export files
3. Run the application and verify all features work
4. Add comprehensive tests for all components
5. Deploy and integrate with existing AI/ML Wrangler system
